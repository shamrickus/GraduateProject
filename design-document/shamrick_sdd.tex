\section{Overview}
TVM is split into two main components, the compiler and the run-time.  The Run-time generates code on the fly, and as
such is the primary mechanism for implementing GRNN. TVM has an included CUDA end-to-end implementation, and features
an extensive API that can be used to extend the CUDA implementation.

\section{GRNN Module}
The GRNN Module is implemented by taking the existing GRNN CUDA code, and converting it to TVM's custom
Intermediate-Representation Relay. This Relay code is then used to generate CUDA code to be ran. Since Relay is
language/hardware agnostic it features a functional API that allows algorithms to be built at runtime. Since CUDA is the
only target of interest, there are several optimizations that can be used to allow the TVM code to theoretically obtain
the same performance results as the native GRNN implementation.

The Relay language requires data to be declared, loaded, and the operations to perform on that data. The ordering of
these operations is configurable through a Scheduler. The Scheduler determines the order in which the operations on the
data is performed.

Relay features several important features needed for leveraging the special hardware of GPUs. It supports the CUDA
memory heirarchry, blocking/synchronization, cooperative-groups, compiler unrolling. In some cases, Relay can do
several things out of the box such as automatical unrolling of code.

\subsection{GEMM Sub-Module}
TVM comes with several GEMM implementations, even for CUDA. That having been said, the GRNN GEMM implementation is a
straightforward implementation.

\subsection{LSTM/GRU Sub-Module}
While each method has different implementations, the conversion process is largley the same for all three. One benefit
of TVM is it allows code reuse between implementations without having a \emph{run-time} performance impact.

\subsubsection{Model}
The Model for each RNN is what does the heavy lifting. It takes in the hyper-parameters and runs the given network
using the specified layers. There are two seperate ways that these can be run: They can be run individually, with the
given parameters and a constant network layout. The other is to allow the user to construct the layers manually and
the model coordinates the running of the entire network.

\subsection{Auto-tuning}
TVM comes with a feature out of the box for finding the optimal parameters on a given system. Each PackedFunc can feature
several tunable "knobs" that can be used to optimize the generated code. Then several configurations of these knobs can
be ran and evaluated to determine the best. Since these configurations can be user-defined, converting the GRNN
configuration selection procedure is simple.

%\section{Product Functions}
%$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user
%perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary
%(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them
%understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of
%related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram
%or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

%\section{User Classes and Characteristics}

%User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product
%functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational
%level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class.

%environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions
%are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the
%project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to
%reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for
%example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).$>$

%implementation constraint.$>$
